There was an amendment made to 
	CB_MIN_09272012 
In which, CB_MIN_09272012 became CB_MIN_09272012A. 
The CB_MIN_09272012A was downloaded and used. The other was not included. 
Reasoning:
In 2015, they began removing the original version without amendments. 
They kept only the amended version. See - 
2015-07-09 Minutes CB Amended 		online OR file name 
"20150709 Minutes CB Amende"
This appears to have continued in 2016 and 2017 and 2020. However, 
In 2020 rather than use the word "Amended" it was changed to "Updated"

In 2014 They seperated the Agenda and Minutes into two seperate folders. 
This continued through 2021.
