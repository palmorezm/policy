In 2020, there are seperate files for public comments included online. 
These files are not included in the minutes analysis. 
Reasoning: 
The public comments are not currently of interest in our study. 
They would require a different combination of regular expressions to extract any information from them

2021 Changed the formating. 
File named: "20211103 Minutes CB"
